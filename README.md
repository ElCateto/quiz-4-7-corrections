# Quiz 4

## Question 9: Which of the following are valid data types in JavaScript? Select all the apply.
I got 0.29/1 pts on this quistion. I missed `symbol`, `null`, `undefined`, and `object`, but i did get `number`, `boolean` and `string` correct. those answers are correct becasue those are things that you use in JS.
```
// budget = true
// budget = 500000
// let costOfcar = Number(prompt("how much does the car cost?"));
// function carCost(){
   if(costOfcar < 500000){ 
   document.getElementById("output").innerHTML = "You can buy the car."
   }
    else(costOfcar > 500000){
    document.getElementById("output").innerHTML = "You can not buy the car."
   }
  }
```
