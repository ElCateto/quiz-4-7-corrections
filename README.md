## Question 9: Which of the following are valid data types in JavaScript? Select all the apply.
I got 0.29/1 pts on this quistion. I missed `symbol`, `null`, `undefined`, and `object`, but i did get `number`, `boolean` and `string` correct. those answers are correct becasue those are things that you use in JS.
```
// budget = true
// budget = 500000
// let costOfcar = Number(prompt("how much does the car cost?"));
// function carCost(){
//   if(costOfcar < 500000){ 
//    document.getElementById("output").innerHTML = "You can buy the car."
//   }
//   else(costOfcar > 500000){
//    document.getElementById("output").innerHTML = "You can not buy the car."
//   }
//  }
```

## Question 10: Which of the following statements declares and initializes a variable called x with the value 27? Select all that apply.

I got this one wrong. The correct answer is let x; x = 27;. It is correct because it is the only one that declares and initializes the variable.

```
// function variableX(){
//    let x;
//    x = 27;
//    document.getElementById("output").innerHTML = "X is" + x + "."
// }
```
